# NodeMCU ESP8266 User's WiFi Configurable ðŸ“¡
This piece of code is mainly create using Micropython for NodeMCU ESP8266 which allow normal user to choose their preferred WiFi for the device to connect. This is useful for IOT production purpose.

As of now this piece of code enable user to connect to the open network only, for those network that have password will can be connected in the next version.

So basically this is the board (NodeMCU ESP8266) that I written and testing this code on.

This is simply show how the system is working.
