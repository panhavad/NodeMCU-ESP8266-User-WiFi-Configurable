# NodeMCU ESP8266 User's WiFi Configurable 📡
This piece of code 👨🏾‍💻 is mainly create using **Micropython** for **NodeMCU ESP8266** which allow normal user to choose their preferred **WiFi for the device to connect**. This is useful for IOT production purpose. 🤑


**How to use?**

1. Connect to the *CONFIG_ME* SSID
2. Password *iwanttoconfigureyounow*
3. Go to *http://192.168.4.1/*

7. Go to *http://192.168.4.1/* to see the board current IP

As of now this piece of code enable user to connect to the **open network**📡 only, for those network that have **password** 🔐will can be connected in the **next version**  🚴🏾‍ soon.


*So basically this is the board (NodeMCU ESP8266) that I **written** and **testing** this code on.😎*
